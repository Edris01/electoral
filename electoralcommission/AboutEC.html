EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Lillies Light Products Uganda is a small scale Partnership business located at Namungoona-Kampala that combines quality, affordability and profitability as our major pillars. We produce detergents and sanitizers that provide quick, easy, and affordable methods to effectively monitor proper hygiene and sanitation in our day to day lives.

Detergents and sanitizers are daily consumer products and this makes them have a high turnover that they donâ€™t stay for long and so Lillies Light Products Uganda is to join other producers that produce the same products to meet the needs of the customers on the market and with proof that every time a customer uses our products, its 100% sure that the consumer will be satisfied. No other product on the market offers such a high level of assurance of sanitation and hygiene compliance.

A member of our team (Human Resource Officer) is to go through Training at Uganda Industrial Research Institute to improve on our the skills required for soaps and detergents production in order to out compete other already established suppliers on the market. This is to improve our products and are to be safe and meet all current UNBS regulatory requirements for detergents and sanitizers.

As our business expands, the CEO, on behalf of the rest of the team is to change its structure from a partnership business by registering it as a Private Limited Liability company with URSB and this is to give our business a more corporate view to our clients and other business entities already in the economy and to do business for a long term not only for the purpose of making money. This is to also distinguish the company assets from our personal assets.
